üõ°Ô∏èSafteyCheck 
is a tool designed to ensure that healthcare workers and visitors wear the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on the patient's condition (e.g., infected or non-infected). A camera captures the image of the person, and the system uses AI to detect whether the necessary PPE is being worn. If any required equipment is missing, the person will not be allowed to enter the patient's room, ensuring safety for both patients and staff.
